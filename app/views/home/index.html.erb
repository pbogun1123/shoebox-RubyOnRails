	<p> We are proud to release our first version of ShoeBox! ShoeBox aims to be a website to develop communities.
		Clients are free to post videos and blogs to share with the community. We are aiming to make this process as easy
		and streamlined as possible. We have many improvements in the pipeline that we are anxious to share. We will be
		providing a post in the near future documenting all the changes we will have in store. In the meantime we hope you
		enjoy our service! If you have any questions or comments we encourage you 
		to share them with us on our contact page.
